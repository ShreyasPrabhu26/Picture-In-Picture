# Picture in Picture Project 🎥🖼️

The Picture in Picture project is a simple yet powerful JavaScript application that allows users to display a media stream (usually a screen or a specific application window) in a picture-in-picture mode. This project showcases how to work with web APIs to capture screen content and create a seamless user experience.

## Features 🚀

- **Screen Capture:** With this project, users can capture the content of their screen or a specific application window. It utilizes the `getDisplayMedia` function to access the user's screen or application.

- **Picture-in-Picture Mode:** Click the main button to enable the Picture-in-Picture mode for the captured media stream. This feature allows the media content to be displayed in a small, draggable window that can be overlaid on other applications or windows.

- **Error Handling:** The project includes error handling to capture and handle potential errors, ensuring a smooth user experience.
